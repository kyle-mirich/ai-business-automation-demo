```

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# You're all set! Just run:
streamlit run app.py
```

Then:
1. Click "📂 Load Sales Data" in sidebar
2. Go to "💬 Interactive Chat" tab
3. Ask questions like:
   - "What were the top 5 products?"
   - "Show me revenue by month"
   - "Forecast Q4 revenue"
   - "Find all Wireless Headphones transactions"

### 💡 Example Interaction

**User asks:** "What were the top products?"

**AI does:**
1. 🔧 Uses `QuerySalesData` tool
2. 📊 Retrieves top 5 products with revenue
3. 📚 Extracts row numbers: `45, 123, 567, 789, 1001`
4. 💬 Responds with specific numbers
5. 🔗 Shows "View Source Data (15 rows)" expander

**User clicks expander:**
- Sees actual CSV rows in formatted table
- Date, Product, Quantity, Revenue, Category, Segment
- Can verify the AI's answer against real data!

**If user asks "Show me detailed breakdown":**
- AI generates: `df.groupby('product')['revenue'].sum()`
- Shows code in expandable section
- User clicks "▶️ Execute Code"
- Results displayed as interactive dataframe
