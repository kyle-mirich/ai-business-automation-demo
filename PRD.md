## Demo 1: Financial Report Generator (Priority: HIGH - Build This First)

### What It Does
Analyzes pre-loaded Q3 2025 sales data using Gemini API to generate insights, then uses Prophet to forecast Q4 revenue. Shows the entire process in real-time with visualizations.

### User Flow
1. User navigates to "📊 Financial Report" page in sidebar
2. Sees a button: **"Process sales_2025_q3.csv"**
3. Clicks button
4. Progress bar appears with status updates
5. "Behind the Scenes" expander auto-opens showing:
   - Step 1: Loading data (shows row count, date range, total revenue)
   - Step 2: Analyzing with Gemini (shows actual prompt sent + streaming LLM response)
   - Step 3: Forecasting with Prophet (shows training status + predicted Q4 revenue)
   - Step 4: Generating visualizations (shows completion)
6. Results display in main area:
   - AI-generated insights (revenue trends, top products, recommendations)
   - 5 interactive Plotly charts (revenue trend, top products, category breakdown, customer segments, Q4 forecast)
   - Metrics summary (Q3 revenue, Q4 forecast, growth rate, confidence)
   - API cost and execution time
7. User can run analysis again or switch demos

### Technical Requirements

**Data File: `data/sales_2025_q3.csv`**
- Generate 247 rows of realistic e-commerce sales data
- Columns: date, product, quantity, revenue, cost, category, customer_segment
- Date range: July 1 - September 30, 2025
- Include ~10 products (Wireless Headphones, USB-C Cable, Laptop Stand, etc.)
- 3 categories: Electronics, Accessories, Office
- 3 customer segments: Consumer, Business, Education
- Total revenue should be around $124,000
- **Important:** Include intentional growth trend from July → September for interesting insights

**Agent Implementation: `agents/financial_agent.py`**

Create a `FinancialAgent` class that:

1. **Loads data** from CSV using Pandas
   - Parse dates correctly
   - Calculate summary statistics (total revenue, row count, date range)
   - Aggregate data by product, category, segment, month

2. **Analyzes with Gemini API**
   - Create a detailed prompt asking for:
     * Revenue trends (July → September growth)
     * Top 5 products by revenue with dollar amounts
     * Category performance comparison
     * Customer segment analysis
     * Areas of concern or declining products
     * Growth opportunities for Q4
   - Use `google.generativeai` package to call Gemini
   - Stream the response (use `stream=True`) so it displays in real-time
   - Set temperature to 0.3 for consistent analysis
   - Track token usage for cost calculation

3. **Forecasts with Prophet**
   - Convert daily revenue data to Prophet format (columns: 'ds' for date, 'y' for revenue)
   - Initialize Prophet model with yearly seasonality
   - Fit model on Q3 data
   - Predict next 90 days (Q4)
   - Calculate: predicted Q4 total, growth rate vs Q3, confidence intervals
   - Return forecast dataframe for visualization

4. **Generates Plotly charts**
   - Revenue trend line chart (Q3 daily revenue)
   - Top 10 products horizontal bar chart
   - Category performance pie chart
   - Customer segment bar chart
   - Q4 forecast chart showing:
     * Q3 actual (solid blue line)
     * Q4 forecast (dashed green line)
     * 95% confidence interval (shaded area)

5. **Calculates API cost**
   - Estimate tokens used (word count * 1.5)
   - Use Gemini pricing: ~$0.001 per 1K tokens
   - Return cost in dollars

**Streamlit Page: `pages/1_📊_Financial_Report.py`**

Build a Streamlit page that:
- Shows title and description
- Has a primary button to trigger analysis
- Uses `st.progress()` for progress bar
- Uses `st.status()` with `expanded=True` for each step in "Behind the Scenes"
- Shows the actual prompt in a code block (`st.code()`)
- Streams Gemini response into a placeholder that updates in real-time
- Displays all 5 Plotly charts using `st.plotly_chart()`
- Shows metrics using `st.metric()` (Q3 revenue, Q4 forecast, cost, time)
- Uses `st.session_state` to store results so they persist
- Includes a "Run Again" button after completion

**Key Features to Highlight:**
- The prompt should be visible and well-formatted - this shows prompt engineering skills
- Stream the LLM response word-by-word or chunk-by-chunk for dramatic effect
- Prophet forecast should show actual training happening (not instant)
- Charts should be interactive (Plotly hover effects)
- Metrics should be prominently displayed

## Demo 2: Customer Support Ticket Triage (Priority: MEDIUM)

### What It Does
Uses a multi-agent system built with LangGraph to process 5 support tickets through 4 coordinated agents: Classifier → Prioritizer → Router → Response Generator. Shows how agents pass information between each other.

### User Flow
1. User navigates to "🎫 Support Triage" page
2. Sees button: **"Process 5 Pending Tickets"**
3. Clicks button
4. 5 ticket cards appear showing customer names and message previews
5. Each ticket is processed sequentially through the agent pipeline:
   - Classifier Agent: Categorizes ticket (SHIPPING_INQUIRY, REFUND_REQUEST, etc.)
   - Priority Agent: Assigns urgency (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Router Agent: Routes to department (Logistics, Refunds, Sales, etc.)
   - Response Agent: Drafts customer reply
6. "Behind the Scenes" shows agent coordination for each ticket
7. Each ticket card updates with final results: category, priority, department, response
8. Summary shows category breakdown and priority distribution

### Technical Requirements

**Data File: `data/tickets.json`**

Create 5 realistic support tickets in JSON format:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "message": "Where is my order #12345? It's been 2 weeks!",
    "customer": {"name": "John Smith", "email": "...", "tier": "premium"},
    "timestamp": "2025-10-30T10:30:00Z"
  },
  // ... 4 more tickets
]
```

Include variety:
- Shipping inquiry (frustrated customer, 2 weeks delay)
- Refund request (damaged product, angry tone)
- Address change (simple, neutral tone)
- Bulk sales inquiry (business opportunity)
- Technical issue (website down, critical urgency)

Mix customer tiers: premium, standard, business

**Agent Implementation: `agents/support_agents.py`**

Create `SupportAgentOrchestrator` class using **LangGraph** that:

1. **Defines agent state** (TypedDict with: ticket, category, priority, department, response)

2. **Implements 4 agents as separate methods:**

   **Classifier Agent:**
   - Takes ticket message
   - Prompts Gemini to classify into one category: SHIPPING_INQUIRY, REFUND_REQUEST, ADDRESS_CHANGE, BULK_SALES, TECHNICAL_ISSUE, PRODUCT_QUESTION, ACCOUNT_ISSUE
   - Returns category + confidence score (0-100)
   
   **Prioritizer Agent:**
   - Takes ticket + category
   - Prompts Gemini to assign priority: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
   - Considers: issue urgency, customer sentiment, customer tier, business impact
   - Returns priority + score + reasoning
   
   **Router Agent:**
   - Takes category
   - Uses rule-based mapping to assign department
   - No LLM needed - just a dictionary lookup
   - Returns department name
   
   **Response Agent:**
   - Takes ticket + category + priority + department
   - Prompts Gemini to draft professional customer reply
   - Response should match urgency level (critical = immediate action language)
   - Keep 3-4 sentences, professional and empathetic
   - Returns draft response

3. **Builds LangGraph workflow:**
   - Create StateGraph
   - Add 4 nodes (one per agent)
   - Connect them: classifier → prioritizer → router → responder → END
   - Compile the graph

4. **Provides helper methods:**
   - `process_ticket()` - runs a single ticket through the workflow
   - `classify_ticket()` - exposes just classification
   - `calculate_cost()` - tracks API usage

**Streamlit Page: `pages/2_🎫_Support_Triage.py`**

Build a page that:
- Shows 5 ticket cards in columns (use `st.columns(5)`)
- Each card shows customer name and message preview
- Uses `st.status()` within each card to show processing steps
- "Behind the Scenes" expander shows agent coordination for each ticket
- For each agent, show:
  * Agent name
  * What it's analyzing
  * Its output/decision
- Update ticket cards progressively as agents complete
- Final ticket cards show: category, priority, department, expandable response
- Show summary metrics: total time, API cost, tickets processed
- Show breakdown: categories (how many of each), priorities (distribution)

**LangGraph Usage:**
- This demo showcases multi-agent coordination
- Make sure to show that data flows: Classifier output → Prioritizer input → etc.
- Each agent should have visible output in the UI
- This proves you understand agent orchestration

## Demo 3: Inventory Optimizer (Priority: LOW - If Time Permits)

### What It Does
Analyzes inventory levels, forecasts demand for each product using Prophet, and uses Gemini to generate prioritized reorder recommendations.

### User Flow
1. User navigates to "📦 Inventory Optimizer" page
2. Sees button: **"Analyze Current Inventory"**
3. Current inventory table displays (50 SKUs)
4. Agent analyzes:
   - Items below reorder point (urgent)
   - Slow-moving stock (overstock issues)
   - Fast-moving items (high demand)
5. Prophet forecasts 30-day demand for each product
6. Gemini generates prioritized reorder list with reasoning
7. Results show:
   - Inventory alerts (low stock items)
   - Demand forecasts visualization
   - Reorder recommendations table (priority, quantity, reasoning, cost)

### Technical Requirements

**Data File: `data/inventory.csv`**

Generate 50 inventory items:
- Columns: sku, product_name, current_stock, reorder_point, lead_time_days, cost_per_unit, last_30_days_sales, category
- Include intentional issues:
  * 5 items critically low (current_stock < reorder_point)
  * 3 items overstocked (high stock, low sales)
  * 10 fast-moving items (high sales)
- Realistic products: electronics, accessories, office supplies

**Agent Implementation: `agents/inventory_agent.py`**

Create `InventoryAgent` class that:

1. **Analyzes inventory levels**
   - Load CSV
   - Identify low stock items (current < reorder_point)
   - Identify slow movers (sales < 10 units, high stock)
   - Identify fast movers (sales > 50 units)

2. **Forecasts demand with Prophet**
   - For each product, create simple historical data (30 days)
   - Fit Prophet model
   - Predict next 30 days
   - Sum predicted demand

3. **Generates reorder recommendations with Gemini**
   - Create detailed prompt with:
     * Items needing reorder
     * Current stock vs reorder point
     * Forecasted demand
     * Lead times
     * Costs
   - Ask Gemini to recommend:
     * Order quantity (considering forecast + safety stock + lead time)
     * Priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
     * Reasoning
     * Estimated cost
   - Parse JSON response from Gemini

4. **Creates visualizations**
   - Inventory levels bar chart (color-coded: red = low, yellow = ok, green = good)
   - Demand forecast line charts for top items
   - Reorder priority breakdown

**Streamlit Page: `pages/3_📦_Inventory_Optimizer.py`**

Build a page showing:
